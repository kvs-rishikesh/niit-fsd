Hey I want to create a webpage using HTML code with bootstrap so generate the code for landing page of "PicturePalette" website​.​
The context should be as follows :
Pinterest is a special app developed by a team of creative minds to help people find and save cool pictures they love. With Pinterest, you can create your own picture collection and share them with friends. It's like having a secret treasure map to awesome pictures that make you smile and dream.​

One special and unique aspect of Pinterest's layout is its use of a "masonry grid." ​

Unlike traditional grids where items are neatly aligned in rows and columns, Pinterest's masonry grid allows images of different sizes and orientations to fit together like a puzzle. This creates an organic and visually engaging layout, enabling users to discover a diverse range of content in a dynamic and artistic manner.​
