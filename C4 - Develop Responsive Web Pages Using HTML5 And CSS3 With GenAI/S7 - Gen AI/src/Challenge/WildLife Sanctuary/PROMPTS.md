I am a frontend developer seeking to create a webpage by using media queries with a navigation bar having the name "Masai Mara Wildlife Sanctuary" and some navigation links beside of that with names Home, About, Gallery and Section. After that, display the image which i have given "https://picsum.photos/id/93/1200/600". In that image, add a caption on that image as "Step into the Wild Wonder: Embrace Nature at its Best. After that, generate some information on your Wildlife Sanctuary by welcoming them in 5 to 10 lines. After that, create a About Us Section and generate some information about your Wildlife in some 5 to 10 lines. After that, create a Gallery section. In that, i need a 4 grid in all the grid i need to add 4 images in each column 2 images should come. After that, create a Contact us section and in that section, add a contact form with name, email and message.
