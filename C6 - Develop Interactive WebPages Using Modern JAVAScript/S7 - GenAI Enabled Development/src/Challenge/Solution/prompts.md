I need you to Develop a web page titled TalentGallery that is both interactive and responsive and can be seamlessly integrated into the TechFusion Solutions corporate website. Employ the `https://randomuser.me/api/` URL to fetch data for 50 user profiles. Show details for 10 users on each page and incorporate a pagination feature for navigating through all employee profiles. 

Integrate a header and footer that adapt well to different devices and achieve this responsiveness using the Bootstrap framework.

In the header, it should have name "Employee Profiles" at left side and some icons of home, info and mail at right side. The background color of the header should be dark and the name and icons  should be light with light border

Implement pagination in the card view. The background color should be white smoke and the border for the cards should be white. Try to give the employee details properly like mentioning Email,Location,DateofBirth and Phone. The images should be round. The details should be right after the image. All the details including image should be center. I need the images should be left and the information should be right of the images

Now try to make images smaller and the employee information per 1 should be in only 1 row

The pagination numbers has also given in 1 column. I need it in row. And make the images some bigger and make all the information at center with all information displaying right to the images

In the footer, at the left add copyright information of "2023 User Profiles. All right reserved". At center, i need some navigation links like Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Contact. At right, i need some social media icons of facebook,twitter and instagram

The line spacing of the employee information is high. Make the images and information be at center and images should be before the information. The employee name should be higher size and the other information should be lower size. The bg color of cards should be white. The numbers for navigating to other page has came in a column and i need it in row

Now remove the border for page navigation numbers and make it dark color. And keep bg color of dark white smoke for all except header,footer,cards and page navigation numbers
